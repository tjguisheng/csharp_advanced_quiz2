MVVM
MVVM stands for Model-View-ViewModel
Model is data, it can from database, local file or any data. Data can be modified but should not take logic or other calculation.

View is what we show to users. It's the actual user interface. It handles data to ViewModel via data binding.

ViewModel connect Model and View, it retrieves the necessary data form Model, applies the UI logic then expose releavant data for the View to consume.
